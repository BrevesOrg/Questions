# README

After getting tired of numerous cognitive interviews for job positions that did not match my profile, I decided to build a service that helps me select potentially interesting job positions and those to avoid without having to do cognitive interviews.
The service is very simple but very useful. It allows the user to write a questionnaire to share with a recruiter / headhunter, and based on the answers, decide whether or not to continue with the cognitive interview.
The service is completely free.

The service is available [here](https://breves.it/?campaign=github) and it is called Breves.

Even if you will not use [Breves](https://breves.it/?campaign=github) (you can create the questionnaire however you like) I think that asking questions to the recruiters is very important.
The purpose of this repository is to help people who are contacted by recruiters.
The repository consists of:
* a collection of questions to ask recruiters before or during an interview in order to understand if the job may interest us or not.
* possible answers to be given to recruiters

## Repository structure

The idea is to have  uestions divided in different files, one for each specific role, except for _general_ which contains questions that do not depend on the role.
